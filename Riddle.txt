THE RIDDLER

The beginning of Eternity, 
The End of time and space, 
The beginnings of Every end, 
The end of every place. 
What am i?

I have lots to say but can never speak. 
Knowledge is the thing I eat. 
Inside me adventures you will find quests and treasures of every kind for all those that wish to visit me your hands are the ultimate key. What am I?
